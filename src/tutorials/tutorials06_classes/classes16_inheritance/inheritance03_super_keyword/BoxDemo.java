/**
 * This class demos the use of keyword "super" to call the parent's constructors
 * "super" is used to avoid duplicating code from superclass in the subclass.
 * "super" has 2 general forms:
 *      1. to call superclass constructor
 *      2. to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of the subclass
 * In this program, we investigate the 1st property of "super", which is to call superclass constructor
 * Here is its general form:
 *      super(arg-list);
 * In arg-list, we need to list all the arguments needed for the superclass constructor.
 * super() must be the first statement executed inside the subclassâ€™s constructor.
 *
 * For example,
 * We have a superclass Box and its subclass BoxWeight.
 * class Box has its constructor Box to initialize width, length, depth fields of Box.
 * Also, in subclass BoxWeight, we also create a new constructor BoxWeight to initialize
 * width, length, depth and weight fields of BoxWeight.
 * As u can see, we're abt to duplicate code of constructor Box in constructor BoxWeight as follows
 *      BoxWeight(double w, double l, double d, double m) {
 *         width = w;
 *         length = l;
 *         depth = d;
 *         weight = m;
 *     }
 * In order to get rid of this unnecessarily long and duplicated code, we use "super" as follows
 *      BoxWeight(double w, double l, double d, double m) {
 *         super(w, l, d);
 *         weight = m;
 *     }
